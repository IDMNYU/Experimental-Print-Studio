### SVG preparation

You can control Axidraw through the Axidraw plugin in Inkscape. Inkscape can open and work with SVG files.

SVG, or Scalable Vector Graphics, is an XML-based format for creating two-dimensional vector graphics. You can create it in various ways, such as using coding frameworks like p5.js or design software like Adobe Illustrator.

For p5js:

Add this script to your index html page

```<script src="https://unpkg.com/p5.js-svg@1.5.1"></script>```


In addition, change your P5 cloud version to 1.6.0 instead of the default 1.10.0 or other versions as shown above. Otherwise you may encounter errors in exporting SVG with this script

Hereâ€™s an [example](https://zenozeng.github.io/p5.js-svg/examples/#exporting ) of the code you need to add to your js file in order to export.

### Pen and paper size

The machine supports a variety of pen types, including fountain pens, permanent markers.
