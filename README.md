# Experimental-Print-Studio

Welcome to the IDM Experimental Print Studio!

The Experimental Print Studio explores the intersection of code and paper-based creative outcomes. We are a space for experimenting with new kinds of drawing, computational approaches in graphic art and design, publishing and zine making. We maintain a risograph printer and a number of paper plotters and support the development of creative coding libraries for printing and drawing such as the [p5.riso javascript library](https://antiboredom.github.io/p5.riso/) and a new [toolkit](./Plotter/README.md) for using plotters with P5.
