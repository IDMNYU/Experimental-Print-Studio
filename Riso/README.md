### What is Risograph

The Risograph is a stencil duplicator. Think of it as a cross between screen printing and photocopying. The RISO prints one color at a time in bright, vibrant colors. It is ideal for posters, graphic prints, zines, comics, and other graphic arts. 
The RISO in the lab is a single drum, only printing one color at a time. To get a sense of how the RISO works watch this [video](https://youtu.be/ofIh4EtGVno?si=sjgOvS4qsWB36E5z).
